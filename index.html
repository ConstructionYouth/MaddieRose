    <p>The Maddie Rose Campaign was established in 2021 to honour Maddie’s life and legacy by inspiring and supporting young people to explore careers in the construction, merchanting and supplier sectors. </p>
    <p>Since joining forces with Construction Youth Trust (CYT), the Campaign has raised vital funds that have helped young people overcome barriers and realise their career potential in the built environment. In just four years, more than 60,000 young people have been supported through CYT’s careers inspiration programmes. </p>
    <p>Beyond fundraising, the merchanting sector has played a pivotal role by working with the CYT team to create engaging resources and work experience opportunities that introduce young people to the industry’s many hidden careers. </p>
    <p>From the outset, it was hoped that the Campaign might one day evolve into a standalone charity. Thanks to the incredible support of partners and supporters, that vision is now becoming a reality. With the full backing of Construction Youth Trust, the Maddie Rose Foundation will officially launch in late 2025, and we look forward to sharing more details in the coming weeks. </p>
    <p>Thank you for your continued support! </p>
    <h1>The new Maddie Rose Foundation website is under development.</h1>
